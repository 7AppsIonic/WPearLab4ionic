  "body": "### Welcome to 7AppsIonic's ~ ionicWPearLab GitHub WP Pages for Ionic / Cordova SDK Framework.\r\nThis automatic page generator is the easiest way to create beautiful pages for all of your projects. Author your page content here [using GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), select a template crafted by a designer, and publish. After your page is generated, you can check out the new \r\n`gh-pages` branch locally. If you’re using GitHub Desktop, simply sync your repository and you’ll see the new branch.\r\n### With the list code and the Angular ng-repeat, the center content becomes:\r\n\r\n\r\n### <!-- Center content -->\r\n### <ion-side-menu-content>\r\n  ### <ion-header-bar class=\"bar-dark\">\r\n    ### <h1 class=\"title\">Todo</h1>\r\n  ### </ion-header-bar>\r\n  ### <ion-content>\r\n     ### <!-- our list and list items -->\r\n    ### <ion-list>\r\n      ### <ion-item ng-repeat=\"task in tasks\">\r\n        ### {{task.title}}\r\n      ### </ion-item>\r\n    ### </ion-list>\r\n  ### </ion-content>\r\n### </ion-side-menu-content>\r\n\r\n### WP Ionic Designer Templates by PearMalaysia Technology S/B\r\nWe’ve crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and click 'Continue to layouts' to browse through them - http://7appsionic.byethost5.com/ionic-app-builder/. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. A publishing engine builder for ionic templates, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved.\r\n\r\n### Creating Ionic pages manually\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor’s GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
